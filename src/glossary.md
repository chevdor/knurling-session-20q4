# Glossary

## HAL

HAL is short for Hardware Abstraction Layer. A HAL is a set of routines that provide interfaces for programms for accessing hardware resources.


## GPIO

GPIO is short for General Purpose Input Output. GPIOs are programmable, uncomitted digital signal pins that can be used as interfaces to other systems or devices. 

## Push-Pull-Output

A pin that is configured as pushâ€“pull output is a type of electronic circuit that uses a pair of active devices, such as transistors, that alternately supply current to, or absorb current from, a connected load. It is an amplifier that can enhance both the load capacity and switching speed between the low or high. Because of the amplification, the voltage of the output is very close to the supply voltage.
