# Glossary

## HAL

HAL is short for Hardware Abstraction Layer. A HAL is a set of routines that provide interfaces for programs to access hardware resources.

## GPIO

GPIO is short for General Purpose Input Output. GPIOs are programmable, digital or sometimes analogue signal pins that can be used as interfaces to other systems or devices. 

## Pin Configurations
### Floating
A floating pin is neither connected VCC nor ground. The voltage will match the residual voltage.

### Push-Pull-Output

A pin that is configured as pushâ€“pull output can switch between high and low voltage.

### Open-Drain-Output
Open Drain outputs switch between "disconnected" and "connected to ground".


### Pull-Up-Input
A pin that is configured as pull-up input is set to VCC, as long as it is not overwritten by an external source. This setting prevents the pin from floating, which can cause noise in the system.
