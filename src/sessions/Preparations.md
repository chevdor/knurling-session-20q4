# Preparations

This chapter contains informations about knurling-sessions, the standard hardware and an installation guide.

## Standard Hardware

Knurling Sessions 2020 Q4 assumes you're using the [nRF52840 Development Kit (DK)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK) as your development board. You can also use any other board supported by [`probe-run`](https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run), but you may have to make some modifications to the provided instructions on your own.

The DK needs to be connected to your PC with *1* micro-USB cables (make sure they're data cables and not just for charging). The chapter on [checking your hardware](./hardware.md) will provide you with more details.

Additionally you'll need the peripherals and parts listed in [this blogpost](https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/knurling-sessions-introduction/).

## Required Software
Make sure to [install the required software](./installation.md) so you can start coding!

## Course Material
Knurling-sessions aims to be as inclusive as possible. This means that some information is available in several forms, for example pictures and text description. We also use icons so that different kinds of information are visually distinguishable on the first glance. If you have accessibility needs that are not covered, please let us know.

# Icons and Formatting we use
We use Icons to mark different kinds of information in the book:
* ✅ Call for action
* ❗️ Warnings, Details that require special attention
* 🔎 Knowledge, that gets you deeper into the subject, but you do not have to understand it completely to proceed.
* 💬 Descriptions for Accessibility

> Note: Notes like this one contain helpful information
