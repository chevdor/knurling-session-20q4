## Introduction
This book is a collection of guided projects to help you get started with embedded Rust.

## Knurling Sessions 2020 Q4: Building a CO2 Sensor 
In the first Knurling-sessions project, we will be incrementally building a CO2 sensor. This is not only a fun way to explore working with electronics and embedded Rust, in the end you'll also have a useful helper, especially if you're working from home: Co2 levels have a significant impact on your ability to concentrate and make decisions, and they drop faster than you think! The device we're building will tell you when it's time to open a window.

**Every Friday**, we will release material to guide you through this project.
Releases can contain:
* new written instructions
* new Video tutorials
* explanation of embedded concepts as video or text
