# Knurling Sessions

This repo contains the sources for the knurling sessions. Sessions are currently under heavy development, with contents being added periodically. Most sessions are currently incomplete, so if the session you're working on ends at an unexpected point, this probably means that there's more to come.

## Updates and discussions on the books content

There's an announce thread here https://github.com/orgs/knurling-rs/teams/sponsors/discussions/1 where post information about updates and added content and welcome general feedback. You're also welcome to open issues that point out errors or improvements on this repo.

## Accessing the rendered version of the book

The hosted version of the book is hosted at https://knurling-books.ferrous-systems.com/. Until the sessions are freely available, there's some lightweight authentication, so you'll need the following credentials:

Username: sessions
Password: KR2ucJjiloJ5P
